                        On March 16th, Rocket Lab successfully launched their 34th Electron mission "Stronger together" 
                        from Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia. Onboard were two satellites from Capella Space, 
                        a U.S. satellite manufacturer. Both satellites are Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites to
                        deliver high resolution earth imagery for commercial customers. "Stronger together" was Capella Space's
                        second launch with Rocket Lab on Electron. <br>
                        The Kerosene-driven rocket lifted from the launchpad at 18:38 ET and delivered it's payload to the target
                        orbit with a 44Â° inclination and 600km height.

                        On March 15th, SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 rocket with a Cargo Dragon capsule on board, 
                        headed for the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr>. This Commercial Resupply Service
                        mission, also called CRS-27, delivered 1,2 tons of science experiments among usual supplies for the ISS
                        crew and hardware. <br>
                        Alongside the Cargo Dragon capsule rode several CubeSats ontop of the second stage, which were deployed
                        into orbit prior to docking with the ISS: NEUDOSE, a CubeSat from McMaster University, three satellites
                        from Northern SPIRIT, built in a collaboration of Yukon University, Aurora Research Institute and the
                        University of Alberta, and ELaNa 50, two CubeSats from the University of Arkansas and Arizona State University.

                        Axion Space recently revealed its new next-generation spacesuit for astronauts visiting the lunar surface during
                        the Houston's Space Center Moon 2 Mars festival. After cancellation of NASAs inhouse xEMU development, Axiom 
                        Space has taken over the task of developing a space suit that would be more flexible and robust to be better 
                        suited for on-surface <abbr title="Extravehicular Activities">EVAs</abbr>. The prototype shown was covered in a 
                        dark cover layer to conceal proprietary design details, but still largely resembled the xEMU prototype shown by 
                        NASA last year. If everything goes to plan, the finished version of the AxEMU will be worn by astronauts during
                        Artemis III, which is scheduled to land near the lunar south pole in 2025.
